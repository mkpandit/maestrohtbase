			<h3>Example</h3>
			<p>In case permission group A and permission group B have different permissions on e.g. AOE (Group A: <code>select, edit</code>. Group B: <code>clone, resize</code>) permissions will be merged (user permissions on AOE: <code>select, edit, clone, resize</code>). There is no need to set permission groups for administrator role, permissions will be set automatically.</p>
			<p>User administration and role-administration plugin is restricted to the administrator role only. This documentation is visible to all users. Setting up permissions:
			<ol>
				<li>Create a permission group (Permissions) and set permissions</li>
				<li>Create a role (Roles) and add permission groups</li>
				<li>Go to user administration, select and edit a user to add a role</li>
			</ol>
