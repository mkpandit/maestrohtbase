			directly from a SAN Storage (iSCSI or AOE) without using any local disk.<br><br>
			For a detailed documentation about how to setup Windows to directly boot from a SAN Storage please refer to the Etherboot Wiki - <a href='http://etherboot.org/wiki/sanboot' target='_BLANK'>SAN Boot</a> and <a href='http://etherboot.org/wiki/sanboot/iscsi_install' target='_BLANK'>SAN Install</a>."

					<strong>Initial Windows Installation on the SAN Volume</strong><br>
					<ul><li>Create a Sanboot-Storage Storage Aoe/Iscsi (please check the requirements)</li>
					<li>Create a new Sanboot-Storage volume. This automatically creates a new Image for deployment</li>
				   <li>Enable and start the 'dhcpd' and 'tftpd' plugin. This automatically sets up a 'network-boot' environment for deployment with Sanboot-Storage</li>
				   <li>Boot one (or more) physical Systems via the network (PXE) - Set the boot-order of the physical System in its BIOS to 1. Network-boot, 2. Boot-from-local-DVD/CD</li>
				   <li>Insert a Windows Installation Media in the physical Systems DVD/CD</li>
				   <li>Now create a new Server using the (idle) physical System as resource and the previously created Sanboot-Storage Image as the Image</li>
				   <li>Start the Server</li></ul><br>
				   The System now reboots assigned to gPXE network-boot. In the (network-) bootloader stage it connects the Sanboot-Storage Volume (either per iSCSI or AOE).
				   It will fail to boot from the connected SAN Volume since it is still empty. It will move on to the next Boot Device (the CD/DVD) and start the Windows installation.<br>
				   You can now directly install into the SAN Volume! - please check the Etherboot Wiki about the installation details<br><br>
				   It is recommended to install the 'Windows htvcenter Client' after the initial installation of the SAN Volume.<br>
				   The Installation Media can now be removed from the physical System (you can also remove any local disk if you like).<br><br>

				   <strong>Deployment</strong><br>
				   After the initial installation of the Windows operating system on a SAN volume is it recommended to use this as a 'Master Template' and to not deploy it any more but just 'snapshots' or 'clones' of it.
				   You can easily create 'snapshots/clones' of the Sanboot-Storage volumes via the volume manager.<br><br>
				   <strong>Cloud Deployment</strong><br>
				   Windows Deployment to physical Systems (and VMs) via the htvcenter Cloud is fully supported for Sanboot-Storage."
