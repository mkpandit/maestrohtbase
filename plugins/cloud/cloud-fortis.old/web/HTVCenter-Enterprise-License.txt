therein. Customer will give full co-operation to HTBase Corp
or its agent carrying out such audit. Customer shall bear the costs of the

added tax at the statutory rate.

Customer under this Agreement, HTBase Corp may charge
the applicable additional license fees covering so arising at the rates in the
relevant Price List as from the first date of the respective exceeding use.

Client License by htvcenter Enterprise and expires automatically at the
end of the relevant paid license period, without notice.
(2) The right to terminate a Client License for cause remains unaffected. A
reason, which entitles HTBase Corp to a termination for
cause, is given in particular if Customer (a) fails to perform any of its

breach of this Agreement, and, provided that where such breach is
capable of remedy, fails to remedy such breach within 30 days of being
notified of such breach by HTBase Corp; or (b) files a
petition in insolvency or has such a petition filed against the Customer
(which petition is not discharged within 30 days after filing) or is subject to
an insolvency proceeding or a proceeding giving protection against
creditors.

9.
Warranty
(1) HTBase Corp warrants that the Software is substantially
in accordance with the specifications as set forth in the Software
Description and free from third party rights, which prevent the use of the
Software in accordance with this Agreement.
(2) Precondition for any warranty claim of the Customer is Customer's full
compliance with all requirements regarding inspection and objection of the
Software provided for in the Commercial Code.
(3) Rights in case of defects shall be excluded in the case of minor or
immaterial deviations from the specifications or in the case of just slight
impairment of use. Material defects and defects of title shall be remedied
by HTBase Corp in reasonable time after being reported to
HTBase Corp. Defects shall be remedied by making free
subsequent repairs or a free substitute delivery, at HTBase Corp’s sole option, 
in particular by supplying, transmitting or providing
an Update or by notification of a work-around.
(4) Defects must be notified in writing or electronically (e.g. via email) with
a comprehensible description of the error symptoms, as far as possible
evidenced by written recordings, hard copies or other documents
demonstrating the defects. The notification of the defect should enable
the reproduction of the defect. This shall not affect the statutory obligation
of HTBase Corp to inspect and notify defects.
(5) Updates are provided at HTBse Corp’s sole discretion to
the Customers for downloading from the relevant website. HTBase Corp will inform 
Customer in written form or electronically
(e.g. via E-Mail) about new updates that are ready for downloading and
will provide Customer with relevant access data required for logging onto
the website, if necessary. Instead of an opportunity to download Updates,
HTBase Corp may provide Updates to the Licensee on a
suitable data carrier.
(6) HTBase Corp does not accept any warranty claims for
any defects caused by revision, modification or editing of the Software or
improper, incorrect or unauthorized use of the Software, especially in the
case of improper, incorrect or unauthorized combination with other
software or hardware.
(7) HTBase Corp does also not accept warranty claims, if the
defect is caused by hardware or software that has not been supplied by
HTBase Corp or if Customer does not make use or does
make improper or incorrect use of Updates provided by HTBase Corp.
(8) Any warranty shall be valid for a period of (12) twelve months as of the
date the Customer was granted the right to use the Software according to
Section 4.1 of this Agreement.
(9) Any claims for damages are subject to the limitations set forth under
Section 10 of this Agreement.

10.
Liability
(1) HTBase Corp shall be liable under the statutory
provisions if Customer raises claims for damages based on a wilful act or
gross negligence.
(2) In the case HTBase Corp is blamed for a minor negligent
breach of a principal contractual duty, the fulfilment of which alone makes
proper implementation of the contract possible, and the breach of which
jeopardises the achievement of the contractual object, and on observance
of which the Customer may duly rely, liability of HTBase Corp in damages will 
be limited to the predictable, typically occurring damage.
(3) Liability for loss of data is limited to the typical recovery expense that
would have been incurred in case of a regular and risk-adequate storage
of data on backup copies by the customer.
(4) Liability for culpable loss of life, bodily injury or impaired health and
liability under the Product Liability Act remains unaffected.
(5) Insofar as the liability of HTBase Corp is limited, this also
applies to the personal liability of HTBase Corp’s employees,
staff members, representatives and servants.
(6) Unless stipulated otherwise above, any liability of HTBase Corp is excluded.

11.
Confidentiality
Each Party will treat as confidential beyond the license term with respect
to third parties all items of information, business transactions, and
documents that become known to the party in connection with the
execution of this Agreement and that have been classified as confidential
or by its nature are considered to be confidential (“Confidential
Information”). The use of such information shall be limited solely to the
scope of this Agreement. A Party will not disclose Confidential Information
-5to any third person except, (a) with the written consent of the other Party,
(b) if and to the extent required to do so by Law, (c) to its financial or legal
advisers in confidence for the purpose of obtaining advice. The Parties will
also impose this obligation on their employees and any third parties that
have been involved. The obligation to maintain confidentiality shall not
apply to information that the Party has proven to have received or to
receive lawfully from third parties or that was generally known before the
offer was awarded, or has subsequently become known without violating
the obligations contained in this Agreement, developed independently of
the other Party without using the knowledge gained from this contractual
relationship.

12.
Final Provisions
(1) All agreements adding to or changing this Agreement will be recorded
in writing.
(2) Details or specifications of the Software on websites, in prospectuses,
in the Software Description or in other documents only serve as a
description and do not constitute a guarantee, in particular they constitute
no guarantee of condition. Guarantees require express confirmation by
HTBase Corp in writing.
(3) Where this Agreement stipulates the written form, this exclusively
means the written form pursuant.
(4) HTBase Corp shall have the right, to make use of
subcontractors as long as such use is not contrary to the legitimate
interests of the Customer.
(5) Customer has no right to retention or to set off, unless the
counterclaim is legally established or undisputed.
(6) The contractual relationship of the Parties is governed by Canadian law.
Exclusive venue is Toronto, Canada. However, HTBase Corp is entitled to sue the 
Customer at Customer’s place of business.
The latter does not apply if a deviant, compulsive statutory exclusive
venue exists.
(7) Should provisions of this Agreement be or become invalid or should a
loophole emerge in them, the validity of the other provisions will not be
affected thereby. The invalid provisions or loophole in this Agreement will
be replaced by an appropriate arrangement that comes as close as
possible to what the Parties appear to have intended according to the
spirit and purpose of the contract.
