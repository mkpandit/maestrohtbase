Those script integrating Xen with openvswitch.
First install and start openvswitch on your Xen Host replacing the regular bridging.
Then please copy them to /etc/xen/scripts on your Xen Host, make them executable
and adjust its configuration to use the htvcenter-vif-bridge network-script.

The Xen Host will then use the setting from the ip-mgmt plugin to set the vlan ids
for each interface correctly.
