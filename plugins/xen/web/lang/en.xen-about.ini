					   As common in htvcenter the Virtual Machines and their virtual disk volumes are managed separately.
					   Therefore the 'Xen' plugin splits up into VM- and Volume-Management.
					   The VM part provides the Virtual Machines which are abstracted as 'resources'.
					   The Storage part provides volumes which are abstracted as 'images'.
					   Server deployment automatically combines 'resource' and 'image'."
