			<b>name</b> can be any identifier as long as it has no spaces or other special characters; it is used as part of the filename.<br>
			<b>version</b> should be the version for the kernel you want to install. If the filenames are called vmlinuz-2.6.26-2-amd64 then 2.6.26-2-amd64 is the version of this kernel.<br>
			<b>username</b> and <b>password</b> are the credentials to htvcenter itself.<br>
			<b>location</b> is the root directory for the kernel you want to install. The files that are used are \${location}/boot/vmlinuz-\${version}, \${location}/boot/initrd.img-\${version} and \${location}/lib/modules/\${version}/*<br>
			<b>initramfs/ext2</b> should specify the type of initrd image you want to generate. Most people want to use <b>initramfs</b> here.<br>
			<b>path-to-initrd-template-file</b> should point to an htvcenter initrd template. These can be found in the htvcenter base dir under etc/templates.<br>
